SimOpt loop was run but only with the RL training and domain randomization (p_phi was passed).
Corresponds to line 1,3,4,5 in SimOpt algo from the SimOpt paper.

N=9 runs. One for p_phi~N(0.024, 2.5*1e-5) and p_phi~N(0.024, 1*1e-6), where 0.024 is the datasheet value for mp.

The weights were not loaded from the previous runs. The runs were thus independant and learning started from scratch for each of the N=9 runs for each p_phi.
